# Java-Twitter-Bot
This is a twitter bot I am working on using the java Twitter4J library.

This program will also be using the JSoup library to get the local weather.
This means that you can customize what information it's pulling and posting with relative ease.

You do have to provide twitter4j.properties file in the root of your classpath with your keys/tokens in this format suggested by twitter4j:

debug=true
oauth.consumerKey= ____________
oauth.consumerSecret= ___________
oauth.accessToken= ____________
oauth.accessTokenSecret= __________
